  Welcome! I'm Evan, a software engineer at Google working on the YouTube Music Understanding team. 
  This blog is just for documenting various side-projects. Currently the main interest is building 
  things in Rust. I worked on ICU4X, the official ICU library written in Rust, made a basic Rust 
  compiler for an FPGA, and am currently working gamedev with Bevy.
